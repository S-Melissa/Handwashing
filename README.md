# Handwashing
In this guided project, I studied the discovery of the importance of handwashing by Dr. Semmelweis.

Questions :

Did the handwashing process used before birth assistance change anything in the rate of mortality ?

Obstacles : 

No real obstacle in this project.

Conclusions :

Yes, of course, it did indeed lower the ratio of death by around 8.4% 1841 and 1850 !

Further work : 

A larger scale data set would have helped to build a larger and maybe better analysis (here the analysis was only on 2 clinics).
